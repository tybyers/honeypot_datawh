    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "This project writeup is submitted to fulfill requirements for the Udacity Data Engineering Capstone project. In this project, I used data sets from three different sources, totaling about 1.25 million rows of data, to create a Data Warehouse on Amazon Redshift. This data pulls together data from a data set compiling log data from a few different [honeypots] (JSON), [AlienVault](https://www.alienvault.com/) reputation data (#-delimited), and IP geolocation data from [freegeoip.app](https://freegeoip.app/) (API/CSV). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to imagine this Data Warehouse had a business implication, we could easily imagine a company with good cybersecurity practices setting up number of honeypots to try to determine what hackers may be attempting to do to their own web applications (see [this blog](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-iot-what-is-a-honeypot.html) for a good description of honeypots). So the company puts out the honeypots and collects data about what sorts of attacks hackers are using against these fake network computers. Then the company wants to see 1) where those attacks are coming from, and 2) are the attackers known malicious entities? In this way, they can do a better job setting up IP block lists for the real web apps, as well as trying to determine what sorts of vulnerabilities they may need to patch for their \"crown jewels,\" which would be the *real* targets for the hackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end-users for this data warehouse are the cybersecurity analysts working for the company, probably only one or two individuals at this point. They might set up dashboards to query the data warehouse every day, or maybe every hour, to see how attacks are materializing. The end-users of those dashboards, however, would be more multitudinous -- perhaps in the tens, including higher level managers. They'd look for trends in where the attacks are originating from, and the ratio of known malicious attackers to new attackers. With the current data model and data set, with the honeypots only distributed over about 4 or 5 different fake network assets, the analytic lift would be small. Later in this writeup, we talk about the \"scaling up\" situation."

    "We used the following data to construct the data model. In total, we upload approximately 1.25 million rows of data to S3. The original format for that data is JSON, #-delimited, and CSV (obtained via API). After transforming the data (discussed more in the \"Process\" section), we upload the data in CSV format to S3 (CSV from S3 makes for much faster load times than JSON). \n",

    "    * This data was mostly collected in 2014 and 2015. Mike Sconzo [@sooshie](https://github.com/sooshie) made the data available via his www.secrepo.com site, and also provided an [iPython notebook](https://www.secrepo.com/honeypot/BSidesDFW%20-%202014.ipynb) with information about how to parse the data from JSON.   \n",

Note: I collected the IP geolocations in November 2019, which is 4-5 years after the honeypot data was collected, so the IP geolocations may have undergone some \"drift\" in that time.    \n",

    "    * This file is updated hourly. I downloaded the file on 2019-11-10 at approximately 11:00 am. Because this reputation database is from the current time, and not from the 2014-2015 timeframe that the honeypots were in service, there may be many \"bad\" actors from 2014-2015 that are no longer in service and no longer represented in the reputation data. However, we were happy to see a relatively large number of \"hits\" that are still active"

This is because not all IPs have a reputation in the `reputation` data, so we decided to keep consistency with the source of the geolocation data and only use the `ipgeo` data, across all rows in the `attacks` table.

    "First I had to do a fair amount of data acquisition and pre-processing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Downloaded honeypot data from SecRepo ([zip link](https://www.secrepo.com/honeypot/honeypot.json.zip)). Used Mike Sconzo's [iPython notebook](https://www.secrepo.com/honeypot/BSidesDFW%20-%202014.ipynb) to understand the formatting and parsing of the data.  \n",

    "  * Saved off: CSV of Honeypot data (not included in this repo due to large size).   \n",
    "* Developed module (in `geolocate_ips.py`) to take above list of unique IP addresses and geolocate them using the freegeoip.app API. Due to rate limits, this process took around 20 hours of download time for 185k unique IP addresses.  \n",
    "* Developed module `parse_data.ip_geo_to_df` to mildly clean up raw IP geo data and save to CSV `data/ip_geos.csv`.  \n",
    "* Downloaded AlienVault reputation data from: https://reputation.alienvault.com/reputation.data  \n",
    "* Developed module `parse_data.reputation_raw_to_df` to convert #-delimited reputation data to CSV (with column names). Saved CSV as `data/reputation.csv`.  \n",

    "\n",
    "* Uploaded 3 CSV files to S3 bucket `s3://honeypot-dend/`. \n",
    "* Develop module to programmatically set up Redshift cluster: `redshift.py`. \n",

    "* Translate database schema to SQL queries `sql_queries/honeypot_sql.py`.  \n",
    "* Develop module to run the table creation/copying/insertion steps: `honeypot_redshift.py`. This class extends the `redshift` class I developed, which is useful.  \n",
    "* Develop scripts to make cluster creation/deletion and data warehouse setup/etl easy from command line. These scripts are in: `cluster_setup.py`, `cluster_delete.py`, `create_tables.py`, and `etl.py`, respectively.  \n",

    "## Hypotheticals for Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "This section attempts to answer the following questions...\"what would we change if...\":\n",
    "* The data was increased by 100x.\n",
    "* The pipelines would be run on a daily basis by 7 am every day.\n",
    "* The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most difficult part about scaling this project to a much larger scope would be the acquisition of data, I believe.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the data by 100x, we would have to significantly change the collection network of honeypots and put several hundred honeypots on the network (this is doable, just expensive). Then, to handle that data, we would need a much more robust pre-processing system rather than just \"my laptop!\" There are a couple ways we could approach this, from putting pre-processing capabilities on the honeypot assets themselves, or perhaps setting up a spark system to do this in a massively parallel way on a central cloud service. Then we'd also have to increase the geolocation capabilities. Since we are only allowed 15,000 API calls per hour, we'd have to move from a free service to a paid service with higher bandwidth. However, we probably have a *lot* of repeat users, so we'd set up a system to check our current `ipgeo` table for geolocations we've already done, and then not repeat those.  We would also have to change the Data Warehouse process itself -- it would not be feasible to delete all the tables every time; we could, however, delete the honeypot staging table each time we do a new data load. The problem would be that the ipgeo and reputation data tables would need to be well-populated with all the current data so that the table joins work. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would still use the same sort of cluster on Redshift, however, even with 100x the data. We would certainly have to scale-up the machine to be larger and faster. But if we're scaling data up by 100x, we probably have the money to do so!\n",
    "\n",
    "As for accessing the pipelines by 7am every day, this is where a real data pipeline would need to be in place. Perhaps what we could do is offload \"new\" honeypot data collection every day at 4am in a batch process. Upload all that data to the honeypot staging table. Then get a list of all the unique IP addresses, and compare those to our already known `ipgeo` data, and see which IP addresses we don't yet have but need to query. Send those IP addresses to our IP geolocator, and upload the new IP geolocation data to the ipgeo staging table. Then, the most straightforward thing to do would be to re-query the AlienVault reputation feed, and upload that to the staging table. The scheduling of these data pulls, pre-processing steps, and uploads could be scheduled via Airflow. We would just need to understand how long each of the steps take so we would know what time to kick off the process every day. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the hypothetical about 100+ people accessing the data every day, the main use case I can see for this is if we started to deploy honeypots-as-a-service, and base a company around this capability. Then we sell access to the honeypot data to all these other companies. This would be similar to the problem of increasing our data 100x. The same difficulties are there -- they main thing we would have to think about is *where* people are querying our data from. Perhaps we need separate, but similar, data warehouses in different regions of the world. Perhaps we keep it all central but just massively scale up the machine. We'd also need to make sure we pay for guaranteed uptime -- our business would go south very quickly if our database was DDoS'd, intentionally or unintentionally! So we'd need a very large, capable cluster, perhaps geographically distributed, with 99.9999% uptime, and the data pipeline pieces (Airflow) in place to assure that customers are getting their data in as timely a manner as possible."
